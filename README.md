## Question 1. One away 

### There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away. 

### Example:
#### pale, ple -> True 
#### pales, pale -> True 
#### pale, bale -> True 
#### pale, bake -> False 


## Question 2. Linked List

#### Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.


## Bonus Question.

#### You are given a particular time (e.g. 3:45pm), find the smallest angle between the hour hand and the minute hand in degrees.
